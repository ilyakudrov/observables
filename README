This project is ment to be a pile of different programs on python and c++ for proseccing latticce QCD data.

It's poorely documented, but here could be some information about some particular programs of this project.

1. Eos rotation imaginary processing:

it's located in code/c++/eos_rotation_imaginary, it has 6 main programs: average_distribution, average_observables_rings, average_observables, average_polyakov_distribution, average_polyakov_rings, average_polyakov.

-how to compile: make ${program_name} DATAFRAME_PATH=${DATAFRAME_PATH} GCC=${GCC_PATH}(optional) ARCH=${ARCH}
example: make average_distribution DATAFRAME_PATH=/home/itep/kudrov/source/DataFrame GCC=/home/itep/kudrov/installed/gcc-13/bin/g++
DATAFRAME_PATH - path to data_frame library
ARCH - appendix to executional name (default: test), i.e. average_distribution_test

requires data_frame library https://github.com/hosseinmoein/DataFrame, makefile takes path to this library (DATAFRAME_PATH)

-how to use:

${program_name} --base_path ${base_path} --beta ${beta} --velocity ${velocity} --lattice_size ${lattice_size} --boundary ${boundary} --result_path ${result_path} --spec_additional_path ${spec_additional_path}

base_path - path to directory with lattice_size
beta - beta dir name
velocity - velocity dir name
lattice_size - lattice_size dir name
boundary - boundary dir name
result_path - path where to save result (has to be created)
spec_additional_path - additional path, where program will try to find spec files

spec files have to be in ${spec_additional_path} or ${velocity} dirs and be called "spec_bin_Pl.log", "spec_bin_S.log" and "spec_therm.log"
spec files are two column space separated files with columns "beta" "spec" (without headr, just two numbers), where spec is corresponding input parameter, i.e. thermalization_length or bin_size
